Any modification is lost. If opened to edit, the Content Item remains checked-in.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Item Details</span><br />&nbsp;<br />Title: Type here is the title of the content. This is the title as it will appear on the page or table listing this content.<br /><br />Title Alias: This field is not used by core.&nbsp; SEF scripts and dynamic title/meta scripts use it and it may have a future use.<br /><br />Section: Choose here the Section you want the item to belong to.<br /><br />Category: Choose here the category you want the item to belong to. The dropdown list will display the available Categories for the Secton chosen above.<br /><br />Intro Text (required): Type here the introductory portion of the content. This is the part displayed in Blog Lists for both Categories and Sections. It can also be configured to be hidden when you view the content.<br /><br />Main Text (optional): This is the body of your content. It is only shown when viewing that content in full view, and is not shown in Blog Lists.&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Content Mambots:</span><br />Content Mambots are special tags you place in your content that Joomla parses to perform a particular action or function. These Mambots will be available (if published) even if you choose NO WYSIWYG editor in the Global Configuration. They may be published or edited through the Mambot Manager (Mambots-&gt;Site Mambots, Filter set to content).<br /><br />The two default Mambots specifically used when editing content are: <br /><ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>{mosimage} (mosimage Mambot): Used to tell Joomla where to place graphics in your content.</li><li>{ mospagebreak} (mospaging Joomla): Instructs Joomla to create a page break in your content. You can break your content into several pages if you like. If you do, a table of content will display to let you navigate between the different pages created.</li></ul><br />Buttons to insert these codes may be published or not through (Mambots-&gt;Site Mambots, Filter set to editor.xtd). You may also manually type them into your content. Remember that in order for your images to show in the content, you must insert the {mosimage} code snippet where you would like your image to be placed in your content. <br /><br />NOTE: The images in the Intro Text can be hidden for Blog Lists. This is a configurable setting for these Menu Items. Also, this is a global setting that will affect your entire web site as a default in Global Configurations. If you are having trouble getting images to display within the Intro Text and the problem keeps cropping up in Blog Lists, then make sure that the Parameters for MOSImages is set to Show for that menu entry.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Formatting content</span><br />The formatting options interface depend on the Editor you are using.<br />Many editors are available as Open Source (through http://developer.joomla.org) or commercial products.<br /><br />Joomla comes with 2 default editors:<br /><ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>NO WYSIWYG: This editor lets you enter text and/or HTML code directly.</li><li>TinyMCE: This editor lets edit in WYSIWYG or HTML mode (See specific Help).</li></ul>NOTE: It is advised to publish only one editor at a time in Mambot Manager and to save also that choice in Global Configuration.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Attributes Area for content consists of five tabs: </span><br />Publishing, Images, Parameters, Meta Info and Link to Menu.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Publishing</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Publishing Info</span><br /><br />Show on Frontpage: Check the box if you want this content to be assigned to the FrontPage Component.<br /><br />Published: Check the box to let the item show on your site.<br /><br />Access Level: Choose who will be able to view this content.
