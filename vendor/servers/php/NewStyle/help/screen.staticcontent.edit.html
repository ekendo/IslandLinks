Mambots are special tags you place in your content that Joomla parses to
perform a particular action or function. These Mambots will be
available (if published) even if you choose NO WYSIWYG editor in the
Global Configuration. They may be published or edited through the
Mambot Manager (Mambots-&gt;Site Mambots, Filter set to content).<br /><br />The two default Mambots specifically used when editing content are: <br /><ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>{<span>mosimage</span>} (<span>mosimage</span> Mambot): Used to tell Joomla where to place graphics in your content.</li><li>{
    <span>mospagebreak</span>} (<span>mospaging</span> Joomla): Instructs Joomla to create a page break
in your content. You can break your content into several pages if you
like. If you do, a table of content will display to let you navigate
between the different pages created.</li></ul><br />Buttons to insert
these codes may be published or not through (Mambots-&gt;Site Mambots,
Filter set to editor.<span>xtd</span>). You may also manually type them into your
content. Remember that in order for your images to show in the content,
you must insert the {<span>mosimage</span>} code snippet where you would like your
image to be placed in your content. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Formatting content</span><br />The formatting options interface depend on the Editor you are using.<br />Many editors are available as Open Source (through http://developer.joomla.org) or commercial products.<br /><br />Joomla comes with 2 default editors:<br /><ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>NO WYSIWYG: This editor lets you enter text and/or HTML code directly.</li><li><span>TinyMCE</span>: This editor lets edit in WYSIWYG or HTML mode (See specific Help).</li></ul>NOTE: It is advised to publish only one editor at a time in Mambot Manager and to save also that choice in Global Configuration.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Attributes Area for Static Content consists of five tabs: </span><br />Publishing, Images, Parameters, Meta Info and Link to Menu.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Publishing</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Publishing Info</span><br /><br />Published: Check the box to let the item show on your site.<br /><br />Access Level: Choose who will be able to view this content.
